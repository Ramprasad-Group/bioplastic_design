  Bioplastic Design using Multitask Deep Neural
  Networks
abstract: Non-degradable plastic waste stays for decades on land and in water, jeopardizing our environment; yet our modern lifestyle and current technologies are impossible to sustain without plastics. Bio-synthesized and biodegradable alternatives such as the polymer family of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have the potential to replace large portions of the world's plastic supply with cradle-to-cradle materials, but their chemical complexity and diversity limit traditional resource-intensive experimentation. In this work, we develop multitask deep neural network property predictors using available experimental data for a diverse set of nearly 23000 homo- and copolymer chemistries. Using the predictors, we identify 14 PHA-based bioplastics from a search space of almost 1.4 million candidates which could serve as potential replacements for seven petroleum-based commodity plastics that account for 75% of the world's yearly plastic production. We discuss possible synthesis routes for these identified promising materials. The developed multitask polymer property predictors are made available as a part of the Polymer Genome project at https://www.polymergenome.org/.
